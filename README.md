# IPC-Debugger
1. Introduction

Inter-Process Communication (IPC) plays a vital role in operating systems, allowing processes to exchange data efficiently. The IPC Debugger is a tool designed to analyze and troubleshoot IPC mechanisms such as message queues, shared memory, and pipes. This project provides a user-friendly desktop application to debug IPC operations, monitor process communication, and detect issues such as deadlocks and race conditions.

2. Features

Real-time IPC Monitoring

Process Communication Debugging

Message Queue & Pipe Inspection

Shared Memory Tracking

Deadlock Detection & Recovery

Graphical Representation of IPC Activities

Error Logging & Process Analysis

3. Technologies Used

Python (Core Programming Language)

Tkinter (GUI Development)

Multiprocessing (Process Management)

Queue & Pipe Modules (Message Passing)

Shared Memory Module (Shared Data Handling)

Logging Module (Error Reporting)

NetworkX (Deadlock Detection)

Matplotlib (Graphical Data Visualization)

4. Usage

Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with dependencies: pip install multiprocessing

Launch the application using python main.py.

Monitor IPC communication and detect deadlocks.

View message exchanges and shared memory interactions.

Use the debugging tools to analyze process behavior.

Click "Check Deadlocks" to detect circular process dependencies.

5. Dashboard Preview

The IPC Debugger interface includes:

Process communication logs.

Message queue & shared memory insights.

Buttons to start, stop, and debug processes.

Graphical charts showing IPC activities.

Deadlock detection and resolution tools.

6. How It Works

Install dependencies (pip install multiprocessing).

Implement IPC communication tracking.

Display real-time logs for process messaging.

Add debugging tools to inspect message queues and pipes.

Integrate deadlock detection using NetworkX.

Test and refine the UI for better user experience.

Monitor IPC traffic dynamically every 2 seconds.

Click "Check Deadlocks" to scan and resolve process conflicts.

7. Future Enhancements

Add process filtering and sorting options.

Implement confirmation prompts before terminating processes.

Improve error handling for restricted access IPCs.

Enhance AI-powered analysis for IPC performance prediction.

Provide graphical insights for historical IPC activity tracking.
