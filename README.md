# IPC-Debugger
1. Introduction

Inter-Process Communication (IPC) plays a vital role in operating systems, allowing processes to exchange data efficiently. The IPC Debugger is a tool designed to analyze and troubleshoot IPC mechanisms such as message queues, shared memory, and pipes. This project provides a user-friendly desktop application to debug IPC operations, monitor process communication, and detect issues such as deadlocks and race conditions.
